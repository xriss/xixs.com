Agincards
=========

Agincards, is a reference to Agincourt a french town not unlike 
Carcassonne and is intended to indicate that this game is related to 
Carcassonne but playable with a pack of cards.

Required: One standard pack of 52 cards. Five similar coins to use as 
tokens. For more than one player each player needs five and they should 
be distinguishable. A piece of paper to write running total scores on 
and a writing implement. A reasonable area to place cards on. The game 
can spread itself out so please give yourself a lot of space.

Agincards is designed to not need any strange parts and most people 
should be able to round up these modest materials. I shall now detail 
the basic game rules for single play. Multiple players take turns and 
keep track of separate scores. The game play remains exactly the same 
as single play although you may want to use more than one pack of cards 
for games with many players.

SETUP
-----

Shuffle the pack of cards.

Deal five cards to your hand and also take your initial five tokens.

Place the rest of the pack face down, this is the draw pile.

Draw one card from this pile and place it in the middle of the table, 
this is the seed card of the map.

Set your initial score to 0, this is a running total, as you score in 
the game this number will go up so keep track of it as you would in a 
game like scrabble.

TURNS
-----

Play one card from your hand onto the map or pass if you so wish.

If you now have less than five cards in your hand then take one card 
from the draw pile into your hand and begin to plot your next move.

Please note, that you must play a card first and then draw a card, not 
the other way around.

When there are no more cards in the draw pile simply play what is left 
from your hand without drawing any new cards. The game is over when no 
player wishes to play any more cards. Probably because they have run 
out of cards but play may end at any time if a consensus to stop is 
reached.

MAP
---

The map is where cards and tokens are placed, whenever you play a card 
by placing it on the map you also have the option of placing a single 
token on top of it. This is the only time you may play a token and you 
may only play one token at a time. This will instantly score you points 
and probably more whilst it remains on the map. However you have a 
limited number of tokens and it may be some time before you can remove 
that token from the map.

PLACEMENT
---------

Each card represents a number and a color, red or black, the suits are 
ignored. Aces are 1, Jacks are 11, Queens are 12, Kings are 13 and of 
course the numbers are their face value.

You can only place a card next to another card already on the map, 
either to the left/right or top/bottom.

You may not place any card next to another card of the same value, all 
touching cards must be different.

When two cards are placed horizontally or vertically to each other they 
begin to form a run. Any two different cards can be placed next to each 
other but to have three or more then you must observe the direction of 
the run.

RUNS
----

A run is a numerical series of cards that goes higher in one direction 
and lower in the other. EG if 4 and 6 are placed next to each other 
then only cards less than 4 can continue the run past the 4 and only 
cards more than 6 can continue the run past the 6. You can never break 
this placement rule, all runs of cards must ascend in one direction and 
descend in the opposite.

DEAD SPACE
----------

By following this placement rule when you place an ace or a king you 
end the run in one direction as no card can be higher than a king or 
lower than an ace. This causes a dead space to exist that no card can 
possibly be placed in after this card. Another way to create this dead 
space is when two runs intersect and no card can be placed that would 
satisfy the conditions of both runs. EG less than 6 but more than 8. 
These dead spaces are important as they can help you reclaim previously 
placed tokens.

SCORE RUNS
----------

A score run is a run that goes up/down or left/right from a placed 
token and is made up of cards only of the same color as the card the 
token was placed on. Gaining score for a score run happens instantly 
when you place a card continuing the run. The score is the length of 
the run, eg 1 point for a single card, 2 points for two cards and so on 
and is awarded to the owner of the token. Multiple tokens possibly even 
from multiple players may score for the same score run. So a score run 
with no tokens in it is worthless and a score run with more than one of 
your tokens in it is highly desirable.

After placing a card you may then choose to place a single token on it, 
at this point any score runs that this token is now part of are 
instantly scored. This means that placing a token will at the very 
least score 2 points. 1 point for a single horizontal score run and 1 
point for a single vertical score run.

RECLAIMING TOKENS
-----------------

Any token that you prove can no longer possibly score any more. EG its 
score run in both directions can not possibly be continued. Either 
because a card of the opposite color has been placed ending the score 
run or dead space prevents any further cards from being placed may be 
returned to your hand. It is up to the player who owns the token to 
spot and reclaim them when these conditions are met.

You may not argue that the cards needed to continue scoring are no 
longer available in what is left of the pack. Only deadspace or a 
change of color can end a score run.

THE END
-------

That's all the rules, when the game ends you will have a score and a 
pretty map of cards. In solitaire play you are just trying to score as 
high as you can (or trying to beat the pack, see below for alt game) 
and when playing with two or more people then highest score wins you 
the bragging rights of a weaner.

HANDICAPPING
------------

You can adjust the number of tokens each player has to balance the 
game, Eg a strong player only gets 4 tokens and new player could be 
given 6.

THE FIRST GAME
--------------

<a href="{_dirname}/agin2.jpg"><img src="{_dirname}/agin2.jpg" 
style="max-width:500px;"/></a>

Played on 19th January 2007. As you can see it requires space.

ALT SINGLE PLAYER GAME
----------------------

Single player no score variant.

Because it is preferable to play patience games with a simple win/lose 
outcome here is how to do the same with AginCards.

Don't keep a score, however every card played must score at least 1 
point, if you can not play a card then you lose. If you play all the 
cards you win.

So as long as you have tokens you can always play a card and place a 
token on it, otherwise you must continue scoring runs. 

This means you must place a token on the first card you play (not the 
initial seed card).

Most of the strategy comes from planing to reclaim tokens.

The difficulty can be adjusted by changing the number of tokens you 
have, If you keep losing with 5 tokens try playing with 6 and so on.

I suspect it may not be possible to win with only one token, no matter 
how lucky you are.
