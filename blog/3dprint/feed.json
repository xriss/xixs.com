Mostly there seems to only be one style available at a \nreasonable price at any one time. So I just made one I could print and \ntweak :)</p>\n<p>This has a V shaped crevice the bottom part of which clamps and holds \nonto playing cards. You might need to tweak this blend file as I just \ndid it by trial and error with the minimum distance apart I could get \naway with printing before it stuck together and that took a fair few \ntries.</p>\n<img src=\"https://xixs.com/blog/2022-09-13-3dprint-game-card-stand/photo.jpg\"/>\n\n<p>It should print OK without any supports and in batches as it is laying \non its side with each layer exactly the same.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve included a gcode as how its sliced is pretty important for the \ngrip and fit. This works with my default ender 3 pro and generic PLA.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

Sure it sounds a bit like the \nghost of Christmas past rattling chains and dragging weights across the \nhard floor but it is still better than the cat screaming at you for \nmore treats five seconds after you just gave them some.</p>\n<p>So this is a 3dprinter recreation of the same sort of device, we have a \nball cavity to fill with treats and a couple of holes to let them out \nslowly with enough vigorous rolling. The simple large screw thread lets \nyou open and lock the ball and works quite well, it has survived cat \nand foot abuse without separating. So you simply open ( using the holes \nas a grip point ) scoop some treats into the half with no holes and \nthen screw it closed again.</p>\n<p>Ideally you want a treat similar in size and shape to a &quot;Dreamies&quot; cat \ntreat, the hole is scientifically designed and tested so that such a \nshaped treat can only fall out when the correct orientation is achieved \nthough aggressive perturbation of the device providing optimal cat \nexercise.</p>\n<img src=\"https://xixs.com/blog/2020-11-22-3dprint-cat-ball-feeder/photo.jpg\"/>\n\n<p>It should print OK without any supports but the roof of each dome will \nprobably fall slightly and need a bit of clean up. However as this is \njust on the inside it is an acceptable print flaw. I&#39;d recommend 100% \ninfill so it is less likely to be crushed when you inevitably step on \nit.</p>\n<p>PLA filament is reasonably food safe and my cat keeps trying to chew \nthe prints and any discarded stringing filament anyway. Still it is up \nto you what you print it with and you can get safer filament and print \nheads if you want. Mostly you are going to get cat treat dust build up \ninside which happens with the store bought ones anyway and requires the \noccasional clean. This is a dispenser rather than a food bowl that your \ncat will be licking, so I don&#39;t think it is that big of a risk.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

Which is \nalso why the STL is upside down, that way it grows upwards like a \nbranching tree and mostly works perfectly until it gets to the feet \nwhich is just OK. It was printed with 2mm of support so the very top of \nthe head sticks to the build plate without being cut flat. The top of \nthe head is still slightly wonky and you need to pull the support hat \noff without breaking the neck but at least it prints.</p>\n<p>In the blender file you see some modifier tricks to get a mesh out that \ndoesn&#39;t crash slic3r using remesh and decimate. Makes the STL file huge \nand blender slow but the output is easier to slice. You can also choose \nbetween lowpoly or smooth by removing the initial subdivide modifier, I \nkinda like the low poly look in 3d prints but other people seem to \nprefer it smooth :)</p>\n<p>This is the <a href=\"https://xixs.com/blog/2020-10-22-3dprint-mr-boneman/Slic3r_config_bundle.ini\">Slic3r config \nfiles</a> I used with an ender 3 pro. I&#39;ve not really had much luck \nwith support materials beyond using it to stick the first few layers to \nthe bed so that is how it is setup. Should take an hour and half to \nprint and if it goes wrong it will be right at the end when it gets to \nthe feet.</p>\n<img src=\"https://xixs.com/blog/2020-10-22-3dprint-mr-boneman/photo.jpg\"/>\n\n<p>In other news after ripping a hole in my magnetic bed cover I&#39;ve \nfinally worked out how to use the glass bed. The secret is Pritt Stick, \nslap a bit of that on each time and prints will actually stick to the \nbed rather than start sliding around halfway through a print. Tried \nother suggested tricks but that is the only one that worked for me. Not \nsure needing glue with each print is an upgrade from the magnetic bed \ncover which I found much easier to use but at least it works now.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

So this was one of the first things I experimented \nwith.</p>\n<p>The indent of the glyphs may seem a little deep (some of the numbers \nalmost intersect) but it really is necessary for useable legibility. \nFor extra legibility you could try and fill in the glyphs with another \nmaterial after printing.</p>\n<p>The blend file is setup to use instanced text objects to cut the \nletters into the main object. Which means you could adjust the \nfont/size/etc if you know how to blender. If you do not know how to \nblender then you want the STL file and will need to slice it yourself.</p>\n<p>I have an Ender 3 Pro loaded with PLA and I use <a href=\"https://slic3r.org/\">https://slic3r.org/</a> \nwith a layer height of 0.25mm which seems a good compromise between \nspeed and quality for a 0.4mm nozzle. </p>\n<p>From various test prints I discovered that you can actually get away \nhere with a 0% infill but a 100% infill seems best as it gives the die \na little bit of heft and helps to keep the weight balanced. </p>\n<p>I recommend not bothering with support or a raft just be extra careful \nwith bed calibration as it is very easy to squash the bottom layer into \nthe print bed rendering its numbers illegible.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n",
