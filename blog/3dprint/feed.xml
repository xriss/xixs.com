<p>Card stands like these seem hard to buy if you want a certain size or 
shape or color. Mostly there seems to only be one style available at a 
reasonable price at any one time. So I just made one I could print and 
tweak :)</p>
<p>This has a V shaped crevice the bottom part of which clamps and holds 
onto playing cards. You might need to tweak this blend file as I just 
did it by trial and error with the minimum distance apart I could get 
away with printing before it stuck together and that took a fair few 
tries.</p>

<p>It should print OK without any supports and in batches as it is laying 
on its side with each layer exactly the same.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve included a gcode as how its sliced is pretty important for the 
grip and fit. This works with my default ender 3 pro and generic PLA.</p>

<p>I have been using a device like this for a few years now, it reduces 
the ability of the cat to inhale treats. Sure it sounds a bit like the 
ghost of Christmas past rattling chains and dragging weights across the 
hard floor but it is still better than the cat screaming at you for 
more treats five seconds after you just gave them some.</p>
<p>So this is a 3dprinter recreation of the same sort of device, we have a 
ball cavity to fill with treats and a couple of holes to let them out 
slowly with enough vigorous rolling. The simple large screw thread lets 
you open and lock the ball and works quite well, it has survived cat 
and foot abuse without separating. So you simply open ( using the holes 
as a grip point ) scoop some treats into the half with no holes and 
then screw it closed again.</p>
<p>Ideally you want a treat similar in size and shape to a &quot;Dreamies&quot; cat 
treat, the hole is scientifically designed and tested so that such a 
shaped treat can only fall out when the correct orientation is achieved 
though aggressive perturbation of the device providing optimal cat 
exercise.</p>

<p>It should print OK without any supports but the roof of each dome will 
probably fall slightly and need a bit of clean up. However as this is 
just on the inside it is an acceptable print flaw. I&#39;d recommend 100% 
infill so it is less likely to be crushed when you inevitably step on 
it.</p>
<p>PLA filament is reasonably food safe and my cat keeps trying to chew 
the prints and any discarded stringing filament anyway. Still it is up 
to you what you print it with and you can get safer filament and print 
heads if you want. Mostly you are going to get cat treat dust build up 
inside which happens with the store bought ones anyway and requires the 
occasional clean. This is a dispenser rather than a food bowl that your 
cat will be licking, so I don&#39;t think it is that big of a risk.</p>

<p>Mr Bone man is upside down because it eases his passage through the 
birth canal and into your dimensions.</p>
<p>This is a test print from my Avatar generator, the mesh had to be 
messed around with a bit, adding something to hold the hands and feet 
to the torso then bones needed thickening up in places and angles 
reduced in order to get it to print without needing support. Which is 
also why the STL is upside down, that way it grows upwards like a 
branching tree and mostly works perfectly until it gets to the feet 
which is just OK. It was printed with 2mm of support so the very top of 
the head sticks to the build plate without being cut flat. The top of 
the head is still slightly wonky and you need to pull the support hat 
off without breaking the neck but at least it prints.</p>
<p>In the blender file you see some modifier tricks to get a mesh out that 
doesn&#39;t crash slic3r using remesh and decimate. Makes the STL file huge 
and blender slow but the output is easier to slice. You can also choose 
between lowpoly or smooth by removing the initial subdivide modifier, I 
kinda like the low poly look in 3d prints but other people seem to 
prefer it smooth :)</p>
<p>This is the <a href="https://xixs.com/blog/2020-10-22-3dprint-mr-boneman/Slic3r_config_bundle.ini">Slic3r config 
files</a> I used with an ender 3 pro. I&#39;ve not really had much luck 
with support materials beyond using it to stick the first few layers to 
the bed so that is how it is setup. Should take an hour and half to 
print and if it goes wrong it will be right at the end when it gets to 
the feet.</p>

<p>In other news after ripping a hole in my magnetic bed cover I&#39;ve 
finally worked out how to use the glass bed. The secret is Pritt Stick, 
slap a bit of that on each time and prints will actually stick to the 
bed rather than start sliding around halfway through a print. Tried 
other suggested tricks but that is the only one that worked for me. Not 
sure needing glue with each print is an upgrade from the magnetic bed 
cover which I found much easier to use but at least it works now.</p>

<p>Dice seem like a good first thing to 3D print, small/fast and they do 
have an actual use. So this was one of the first things I experimented 
with.</p>
<p>The indent of the glyphs may seem a little deep (some of the numbers 
almost intersect) but it really is necessary for useable legibility. 
For extra legibility you could try and fill in the glyphs with another 
material after printing.</p>
<p>The blend file is setup to use instanced text objects to cut the 
letters into the main object. Which means you could adjust the 
font/size/etc if you know how to blender. If you do not know how to 
blender then you want the STL file and will need to slice it yourself.</p>
<p>I have an Ender 3 Pro loaded with PLA and I use <a href="https://slic3r.org/">https://slic3r.org/</a> 
with a layer height of 0.25mm which seems a good compromise between 
speed and quality for a 0.4mm nozzle. </p>
<p>From various test prints I discovered that you can actually get away 
here with a 0% infill but a 100% infill seems best as it gives the die 
a little bit of heft and helps to keep the weight balanced. </p>
<p>I recommend not bothering with support or a raft just be extra careful 
with bed calibration as it is very easy to squash the bottom layer into 
the print bed rendering its numbers illegible.</p>
