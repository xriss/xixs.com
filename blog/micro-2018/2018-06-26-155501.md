https://twitter.com/davidcapello/status/1011583115184300034 @davidcapello I don't have that fear of no static typing, I guess that is because I started with asm?

I also never use any magic dev tools for refactoring, I hardly even use debugers. Mostly since I often get into situations where they do not work (eg debuging netcode)
