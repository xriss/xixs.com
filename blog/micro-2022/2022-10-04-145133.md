Been playing a lot of this since release, mostly because I only have one hand at the moment, and it is playable with just a mouse.

Plays kinda like satisfactory style throughput juggling in smaller puzzle like levels with set objectives. Not a tycoon style game. https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1575508437538054148
