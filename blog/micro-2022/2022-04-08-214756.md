@____rory____ @IATI_aid This one time I reverse engineered a data file format, Acclaim motion format I think it was called, for mocap data animation, anyway.

Then I had a visit from someone from Acclaim who wanted me to explain the format back to them because nobody there knew what it was anymore :)
