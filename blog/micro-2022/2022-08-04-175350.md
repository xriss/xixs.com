I switched from PC to GBA games in the early 2000s specifically because I figured I could make them faster than they could be cancelled.

Around 6 month or less (sometimes much less) dev time.

and even then I had projects cancelled halfway through :) https://twitter.com/jeremy_peel/status/1554765263265988610
