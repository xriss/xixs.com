Hello, it is me, The Dark Lord.

Today I would like to apologies for accidentally ushering in the Age of Dark.

You see I got a bit turned around during the fight there and ended up walking out of the door I came in by.

Then everything snowballed and, well, here we are.

My bad. https://twitter.com/DarkSoulsGame/status/1440586756877795330
