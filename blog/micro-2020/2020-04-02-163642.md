@johnmclear @ghalfacree @johnleach The builds on http://snapcraft.io are quite fast, I uhm, lazily, just kept pushing config changes to git and letting it rebuild. :)

and yeah docs are bad/old best bet is finding other peoples snapcraft.yaml files. eg https://github.com/xriss/gamecake/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml but mine is mostly hardware hacks.
