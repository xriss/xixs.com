I have been using a device like this for a few years now, it reduces 
the ability of the cat to inhale treats. Sure it sounds a bit like the 
ghost of Christmas past rattling chains and dragging weights across the 
hard floor but it is still better than the cat screaming at you for 
more treats five seconds after you just gave them some.

So this is a 3dprinter recreation of the same sort of device, we have a 
ball cavity to fill with treats and a couple of holes to let them out 
slowly with enough vigorous rolling. The simple large screw thread lets 
you open and lock the ball and works quite well, it has survived cat 
and foot abuse without separating. So you simply open ( using the holes 
as a grip point ) scoop some treats into the half with no holes and 
then screw it closed again.

Ideally you want a treat similar in size and shape to a "Dreamies" cat 
treat, the hole is scientifically designed and tested so that such a 
shaped treat can only fall out when the correct orientation is achieved 
though aggressive perturbation of the device providing optimal cat 
exercise.

It should print OK without any supports but the roof of each dome will 
probably fall slightly and need a bit of clean up. However as this is 
just on the inside it is an acceptable print flaw. I'd recommend 100% 
infill so it is less likely to be crushed when you inevitably step on 
it.

PLA filament is reasonably food safe and my cat keeps trying to chew 
the prints and any discarded stringing filament anyway. Still it is up 
to you what you print it with and you can get safer filament and print 
heads if you want. Mostly you are going to get cat treat dust build up 
inside which happens with the store bought ones anyway and requires the 
occasional clean. This is a dispenser rather than a food bowl that your 
cat will be licking, so I don't think it is that big of a risk.
