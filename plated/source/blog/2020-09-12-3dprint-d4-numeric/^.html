Dice seem like a good thing to 3D print, small/fast and 
they have an actual use. So this was one of the first things I tried to 
model.

The indent of the letters may seem a little deep (some of the numbers 
almost intercept) but it really is necessary for legibility. 

The blend file is setup to use text objects to cut the letters into the main 
object. Which means you could adjust the font/size/etc if you 
know how to operate blender.

I have an Ender 3 Pro loaded with PLA and I use Slic3r and a layer 
height of 0.25mm which seems a good compromise between speed and 
quality for a 0.4mm nozzle.

From various test prints I discovered that you can actually get away 
with a 0% infill but a 100% infill seems best as it gives the die a 
little bit of heft and helps to keep the weight balanced. 

I recommend not bothering with support materials or a raft just be 
extra careful with bed calibration as it is easy to squash the bottom 
layer into the print bed rendering the numbers illegible.
