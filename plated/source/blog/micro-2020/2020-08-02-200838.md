https://twitter.com/wetgenes/status/1289999019775647744 I can't say I have ever had a positive use case for nan values?

Does anyone?

It is just a source of stupid bugs every single bleedin time.

One of the simplest QA breaks is just inputting a NaN.

I am wasting my life putting " if x != x then x = 0 " everywhere :)
