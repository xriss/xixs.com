Card stands like these seem hard to buy if you want a certain size or 
shape or color. Mostly there seems to only be one style available at a 
reasonable price at any one time. So I just made one I could print and 
tweak.

Having a V shaped crevice the bottom part of which clamps and holds 
onto playing cards. You might need to tweak this blend file as I just 
did it by trial and error with the minimum distance apart I could get 
away with printing before it stuck together and that took a fair few 
tries.

It should print OK without any supports and in batches as it is laying 
on its side with each layer exactly the same.

I've included a gcode as how its sliced is pretty important for the 
grip and fit. This works with my default ender 3 pro and generic PLA.
