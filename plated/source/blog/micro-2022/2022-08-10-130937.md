I wonder if you could do a "Bridge Builder" style physics game but with dams and a decent water simulator.

So the water slowly builds up and then CRACK WHOOSH you fluffed it.

Everyone loves seeing a dam burst and it can be a 2D building slice interface for a 3D simulation. https://twitter.com/gutenberg_new/status/1557144778214494208
