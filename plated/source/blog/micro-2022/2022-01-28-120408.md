https://twitter.com/bbbradsmith/status/1486818872066027521 @bbbradsmith @MonstersGo I remember writing a lot of what I considered "Lazy" Assembler as a halfway house between Asm and C.

By lazy I just meant that I did not care about speed and it was meant to be easy to write/read.

So, you know, kinda readable. :)
