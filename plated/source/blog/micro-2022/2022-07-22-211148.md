https://twitter.com/wetgenes/status/1550572288050954246 I recently found out we lost Bernie Drumond, had not seen him in years but was still kinda in touch over the internets, and he was still as cray cray as ever, standard artist.

This is his youtube https://www.youtube.com/user/Berniecopycat1947/videos here you can see he made some weird shit nobody liked. :)
