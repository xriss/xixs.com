WetIce
======

WetIce is a competitive two player match three style puzzle game 
designed to be playable with only a standard pack of cards.

**Required:** One standard pack of 52 cards and enough playing space to 
lay them out in an 8 by 6 grid.


SETUP
-----

Remove all four Kings and all jokers.  
You should be left with 48 suit cards.  

Shuffle and deal the cards in front of you **face 
up** in a grid:  
8 cards wide and 6 cards high

Only the suit matters so ignore the face value of the cards.

**Match 3 or more cards of the same suit in a line.  
Horizontally and vertically but never diagonally.**


CLEANUP PHASE
--------------

Take turns to remove all matches on the board before you start a game.

Each player performs one swap of *any* two cards on the grid. 

After the two cards are swapped, there **must** be less matches on the 
board than there was before.

Alternatively a player may pass.

Once all players agree that all matches have been removed by passing, 
the game begins.

**The *last* player to make a swap during this phase is the *first* 
player to take a turn when the game begins.**


GAME
----

Players take turns.

Each turn consists of one **SWAP** followed by multiple **MATCH** and 
**FALL** phases.

See below for more detailed descriptions of these three phases.


SWAP
----

Swap *any* two cards.

This swap **must** create a line of 3 or more cards of the same suit, 
horizontally or vertically.

You may pass to skip a turn regardless of whether you can perform a 
valid swap or not.



MATCH
-----

Remove any lines of 3 or more cards of the same suit.

If this is a **new** suit, it goes into your score pile.  

Otherwise it goes to the player who already has that suit in their 
score pile.

If you have **more** than two suits in your score pile, any extra suits 
must be given to your opponents score pile.

You can give your opponent *any* extra suits - it does not have to 
be the suit that you just removed from the board.

Ultimately, each player will have 2 suits each.

Any future cards removed from the board will go to the score pile of 
the player with the corresponding suit, regardless of who removes them.


FALL
----

Apply gravity by sliding *all* cards down that are not on the bottom 
row or held up by a card below them.

Once all cards have been slid down then go back to MATCH phase and 
remove any new matches. in this way you can chain score multiple times 
from a single SWAP. This MATCH and FALL cycle is repeated until there 
are no more matches to remove or cards to fall.

If there are no cards to fall down or match then your turn is over and 
it is now your opponents turn.


GAME OVER
---------

When both players pass, usually because no more valid moves can be 
made, the game is over.

Your score is simply the number of cards in your score pile. Highest 
score wins.


MISTAKES
--------

There are a few places where we say if both players pass then this 
phase is over as there are no more moves to be made. It is of course 
possible that a match was missed by both players and not noticed until 
later.

In this case you simple remove and score the match as normal during the 
next MATCH phase of your turn even if it has just been sitting there 
unnoticed.


ALTERNATIVE LAYOUT
------------------

For a slightly harder more volatile challenge rotate the board around 
so it is 6 wide and 8 high with the cards on their sides. This makes 
gravity have more of an effect (each column is 8 high) so it is a bit 
harder to manage chain reactions.


SINGLE PLAYER GAME
------------------

The single solitaire player game is played the same as the two player 
game but you take all of the turns and rather than two separate score 
piles the objective is to remove *all* cards from the board.

The more cards you remove the better you played and if you can remove 
all of them then you are the winner.

If this is still too easy then try the NG+ rules by removing as many 
cards as possible in groups of 4 or more. Keep the cards removed in 
matches of three separate to the cards removed in four or more. You win 
by clearing the boards and your pile of four plus cards containing more 
cards than your pile of three.
