WetIce
======

WetIce is a competitive two player match three style puzzle game 
designed to be playable with only a standard pack of cards.


Required: One standard pack of 52 cards and enough playing space to lay 
them out in an 8 by 6 grid.


SETUP
-----

Remove all four of the Kings and all jokers etc as they will not be 
used in this game. You should be left with 48 suit cards. Shuffle these 
remaining cards and deal them out in front of you face up in a grid 8 
cards wide and 6 cards high.

The face value of these cards is ignored only the suit matters and this 
game is concerned with matching 3 or more cards of the same suit in a 
line either horizontally or vertically but never diagonally.

The final part of setup is the CLEANUP phase, see below.

CLEANUP
-------

Because you have just created a random grid of cards there will 
probably already be some matches on the board, so before the game can 
begin this CLEANUP phase is needed to remove all of these matches.

Players take turns to perform a single swap of *any* two cards on the 
grid, after the two cards are swapped there *must* be less matches on 
the board than there was before. Alternatively a player may pass. Once 
both players agree that all matches have been removed by passing then 
the game begins.

The *last* player to make a swap during this setup phase is the *first* 
player to take a turn when the game begins.


GAME
----

Players take turns.

Each players turn consists of SWAP followed by multiple MATCH and FALL 
phases before the board comes to rest again and it is the next players 
turn.

See below for more details descriptions of these three phases.


SWAP
----

On your turn your main move consists of swapping *any* two cards, this 
swap *must* create a line of 3 or more cards of the same suit, 
horizontally or vertically.

or you can pass, if you do not wish or can not perform a valid swap.



MATCH
-----

Any matching suit lines of 3 or more on the board are now removed.

If this is a new suit then it goes into your score pile, otherwise it 
goes to the player who already has that suit in their score pile.

If you have more than two suits in your score pile then any extra suits 
must be given to your opponents score pile, but it does not *have* to 
be the suit that you just removed from the board.

After the first few turns the two players will have 2 suits each and 
any future cards that are removed from the board will simply score for 
the appropriate player no matter who made the move that caused them to 
be removed.


FALL
----

Apply gravity by sliding *all* cards down that are not on the bottom 
row or held up by a card below them.

Once all cards have been slid down then go back to MATCH phase and 
remove any new matches. in this way you can chain score multiple times 
from a single SWAP. This MATCH and FALL cycle is repeated until there 
are no more matches to remove or cards to fall.

If there are no cards to fall down or match then your turn is over and 
it is now your opponents turn.


GAME OVER
---------

When both players pass, usually because no more valid moves can be 
made, the game is over.

Your score is simply the number of cards in your score pile. Highest 
score wins.


MISTAKES
--------

There are a few places where we say if both players pass then this 
phase is over as there are no more moves to be made. It is of course 
possible that a match was missed by both players and not noticed until 
later.

In this case you simple remove and score the match as normal during the 
next MATCH phase of your turn even if it has just been sitting there 
unnoticed.


ALTERNATIVE LAYOUT
------------------

For a slightly harder more volatile challenge rotate the board around 
so it is 6 wide and 8 high with the cards on their sides. This makes 
gravity have more of an effect (each column is 8 high) so it is a bit 
harder to manage chain reactions.


SINGLE PLAYER GAME
------------------

The single solitaire player game is played the same as the two player 
game but you take all of the turns and rather than two separate score 
piles the objective is to remove *all* cards from the board.

The more cards you remove the better you played and if you can remove 
all of them then you are the winner.

If this is still too easy then try the NG+ rules by removing as many 
cards as possible in groups of 4 or more. Keep the cards removed in 
matches of three separate to the cards removed in four or more. You win 
by clearing the boards and your pile of four plus cards containing more 
cards than your pile of three.
